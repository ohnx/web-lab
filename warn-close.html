<h1>Warn Close</h1>
<p>Ever pressed Control-shift-Q by accident and quit all your chrome tabs, including losing 2 pages worth of Incognito tabs?</p>
<p>Have you ever watched in sheer horror as your 50 chrome tabs closed one by one?</p>
<p>I have. This web page fixes that; by keeping it up, you will get a confirmaion message before you close all tabs. Yay!</p>

    (function() {
        window.onbeforeunload = function() {
            return 'Are you sure you want to quit Chrome? (you probably don\'t; press \'Cancel\' to cancel quitting Chrome!)' ;
        };
    })();
